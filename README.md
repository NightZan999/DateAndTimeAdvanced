# DateAndTimeAdvanced
This takes PHP's Date and Time systems to the maximum! Making plenty of easy to use methods!

## Install
There are multiple ways to download this API and start using it!
* Download by cloning repo (`git clone https://github.com/NightZan999/DateAndTimeAdvanced.git`)
* Put it in composer.json (not recommended)
```json
{
    "require" : {
        "nightzan999/date-and-time-advanced" : ">=1.0.0"
    }
}
```
* Download composer and then force install (recommended)
Get it through curl
1. `curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php`
Get it through PHP
2. `php composer.phar install`

Now with composer force install our API:
`composer require nightzan999/date-and-time-advanced`
And well, now use our API

```php
require 'nightzan999/filename.php'; // worst way to do it but still works D:
```

## Setup
Installation with composer can be seen in composer.json! But otherwise install curl and normally install dependencies (that's how I started lol). 
install.sh should start up the program. The PHP is just supporting your PHP so ideally it does nothing. 

I am just a novice at PHP, so feel free to tell me what you personally think. I wont get offended if you say I don't know what I am doing (I really don't lol). 
There are 1000s of people who are much better than me at PHP so feel free to fork and add your changes. 

### Support for custom servers
Currently, you will have to add your server manually. But later I will hardcode something for CPanel users (super hard but ok). 
I will try my best to port this API over to some of the biggest server markets in the industry, but don't complain if I fail (chances are that I will though). 

Anyways, read our docs (in BETA). 

## Credits
1. **NightZan999:** Thats me! I was kind of bored with PHP DateAndTime, so I made it for more advanced date-and-time, and now its a package!
Documentation will be avalible when I finish github automation and also when I finish version 1 of the library.
